# ⚔️ Simple RPG Game (Python Project)

## 📖 Description
A small text-based **RPG battle game** written in Python.  
You can create your own player, fight against an Orc, and see who survives after a few turns of battle!  
Each attack deals random damage, and sometimes a magical counterattack can hit back — so every round feels different.  

This was one of my first Python projects where I started practicing:
- classes and objects (basic OOP structure)  
- loops and conditionals for game flow  
- using random numbers for dynamic damage  
- working with functions and methods

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Create your own player with a name and health value  
✅ Attack an enemy and deal random damage  
✅ Chance of magical counterattack after strong hits  
✅ Show health for both player and enemy  
✅ Game ends when someone’s health drops to 0 or after 5 turns

## 🧠 Example Output
Welcome to RPG World

Please give the name: agi
Please give the health: 100

What you want to do next?:

Attack

Show Healths

End match
:> 1
agi attacking Orc
Attacking...
Player Orc is taking 71 damage , remaining life: 29
Player agi is hit by a magical counterattack! Loses 25 damage , remaining life: 75

## 🚀 Ideas for Version 2
- Add automatic **enemy turns** (Orc attacks back)  
- Add **experience points (XP)** and leveling  
- Add **healing potions** or special abilities  
- Improve text layout and pacing with animations
